--After downloading the files go into the folder: "newproject-main", then extract the folder: "argyyy#1355" into your injector workspace and excute this code:
```lua
loadfile("argyyy#1355/Source/UI.txt")()
```
--[[
This script was made by argyyy#1355

Changing anything (Code/Folders) Will make the script not work

Script was made mainly for Da Hood and maybe a few other games

Script was made to use in Synapse X, it might work on other injectors tho i'm not sure

I release this for some special ed kids trying to legit/closet play (Get what I mean), and stop using other retarded scripts which made by full skids/pasters

Code isn't fully made by me but the main of it is made by me

It's a complete legit gaming chair it might have a few features which aren't legit but it's your choice what to use

It should drop fps because I didn't put effort in optimizing it, low people servers should run fine

Please don't message me about any shit you want in it, only bugs

Dming me for stupid reason will make me block you cause no speds in dms!

And yeah thats it
